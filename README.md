# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## This prework study guide was created for the use by bootcamp students to better there understanding and comprehension of coding. Within this project is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding. 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? 
To learn a new career skill in order to change my current Job trajectory into a feild I am interested in learning about.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") 
To better my basic understandings of coding, and to build a tool that will help with studying. 
- What problem does it solve? 
This project helps solve when a student feels lost and doesn't know what to study or they may look back on previous notes that can help ensure efficent code.
- What did you learn?
I learned that coding is constanty growing and new code is always being made. Therefore, a developer has to keep an open mindset when looking at the future/intended use age of there code. However, not matter how much testing a dev may do his code can always become better as unepected situations always arise. 



If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation


‚ÄúN/A‚Äù for this section.

## Usage

Each section of the webpage has note tied to different coding languages that create the project. Through using the JavaScript a student can be given a random topic to then study. 

## Credits

‚ÄúN/A‚Äù.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
